Xgaming Server Features

Xgaming is a unique Minecraft server that features AI plugins integrated directly into the multiplayer Minecraft experience. The AI features include:

Raju the Trader
An AI-powered trader who can barter trades with players. Players can come up to his shop and ask for items in English, Hindi, and even Punjabi. Raju considers their request, checks the player’s inventory, and gives the best possible items. For example, if a player needs arrows but Raju doesn’t have arrows in his inventory, he will offer flint and feathers and explain the arrow recipe. Raju generates trades based on the player’s gameplay style, their requests, and their inventory.

On-Demand Assets
Players on the Xgaming server don’t need to wait for anyone to add new items to the server—they can do it themselves, and that too with a single command! Players simply type in `/generate` followed by a description of their item, and it’s in their hands within seconds. The command also applies applicable enchantments, effects, and gives the item a cool name and lore.

Quest Generation
Players on the Xgaming Minecraft server never run out of quests, thanks to AI-powered quest NPCs who keep giving rich, story-driven quests personalized to each player.


Ranks
Players can purchase ranks by using the `/rank` command. This opens aGUI menu, where all the ranks are displayed along with theirbenefits, commands, and prices. It’s super simple to choose and buy a rank!

Benefits of Ranks:
Ranked players have access to some extra features compared to normal players, such as:

-Set more than one home using `/sethome`.
- Use `/craft` to craft items directly without needing a crafting table.
- Use `/recipe` to see the crafting recipe of any item.
- Claim akit with `/kit`, which provides useful items—saving you the grind to craft them.
- Use `/feed` to fill your hunger bar, even if you don’t have any food items.
- Locate nearby players using `/near`.
- Clear all useless items from your inventory with `/disposal`.
- Set the time for yourself with `/ptime`, like making it daytime for you while it’s nighttime for others.
- Similarly, set your personal weather with `/pweather`, so you can make it sunny even if it’s raining on the server.
- Access yourEnder Chest anytime using `/enderchest` or `/echest`, even if you don’t have an Ender Chest nearby.
- Heal yourself with `/heal`, which is something normal players can never do.

Additionally, there are a few smaller but fun commands, like:
- `/hat` to wear any item on your head.
- `/sit` to sit anywhere you like.

Weekly Events
The server regularly hostsweekly events to keep things fun and engaging. Some popular events include:
-Build Battles where players compete to create the best designs.
-Wars for those who love PvP action.
-Redstone Events to show off creativity and technical skills.
Event Scheduling:
When fresh event ideas start running low, theweekly events take a break. Sometimes there’s a gap of2 weeks, and occasionally3 weeks before the next event happens.
Why the Gap?
Hosting events too consistently can make players lose interest and get bored, so the team spaces them out to keep things fresh and exciting. On average, there’s a2-week gap between events, ensuring players stay excited for what’s coming next!

About Events
The last event took place the Sunday before last, whereHelix was the winner. As a reward, they received acustomized Xgaming t-shirt!
