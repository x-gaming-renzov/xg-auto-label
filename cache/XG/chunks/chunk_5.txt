{'body': 'I am the lead developer of what I believe to be a pretty unique concept for a Minecraft game mode. I am developing an extraction game mode where you queue for a game with other players to enter a randomly generated dungeon filled with random loot and items. If you die, you lose everything you found and what you brought in with you. If you survive, you get to keep what you found. There are many familiar features such as competing with players for loot, fighting mobs, solving puzzles, crafting weapons and armor, and more. However, the overall concept is not something I have ever seen in Minecraft, and definitely not the way we have done it because it is all designed and built from the ground up, fully vanilla client server.\n\nJoin the IP "[voidwars.primearca.de](https://voidwars.primearca.de)" if you are interested, or join our discord at [https://discord.gg/JrDhVcKtWC](https://discord.gg/JrDhVcKtWC)', 'replies': [{'body': "That actually sounds really cool..
