{'body': "If you're looking for a Minecraft Survival server with a friendly community, CatCraft might just be the best out there. It’s been running for nearly five years, it's lag-free, with a player-driven diamond economy and monthly updates & events to keep things fresh.\n\nThe Overworld never resets, so your progress is never lost even if you take a long break. You can claim your land to prevent grief and enjoy tons of quality-of-life features that make gameplay fun. Also, there's a marketplace where you can run your own shop and sell items through chest shops.\n\nThe only downside? The chat filter is a bit strict because it’s family-friendly, but DMs (/msg), clan chat, and group chat are exempt from the filter, so you can still have private conversations.\n\nIP: [rd.catcraft.net](http://rd.catcraft.net)", 'replies': []}
