{'body': 'RSMV.net has some fun games! My favorite is the Labyrinth. Labyrinth is a big puzzle on how to escape and it’s filled with a ton of lore. It was also made by one guy named Remodactyl and he spent 7 years making it. It’s really amazing and worth trying to escape imo. There’s also Story Book which is a section of the server with a ton of fun minecraft maps you can play!', 'replies': []}
