{'body': "There's this medieval minecraft server that I'm in. It goes back into the medieval times and gives you tasks each week to complete to have the server active. It operates through discord so you need vc to join the game because you're not allowed to type in the server. Makes it easy to communicate with your people. There's also separate continents where you are assigned to a specific one. Having kings, queens, princesses, and princes. Like royals. You can also become a one of those as your work your way up. You make a lot of new friends on the way and they also host bedwar tournaments on hive. It's really fun. If you wanna join then send a message so you can acess their discord server and minecraft server. Remember you need to have discord with vc!!", 'replies': [{'body': 'What server is this', 'replies': [{'body': 'terrible server', 'replies': []}]}]}
