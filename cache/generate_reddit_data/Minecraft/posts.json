These are some of my newest glaciers. Including the \"Jacie\" and \"Porter\" glacier. Other glaciers along this Fjord I have built include the Kusauh, and the Harlette Glacier. \n\nThe little cabin house I made is a small developing village I'm working on called \"Little Harlow\" named after my North capitalist city in this world called \"Harlow\" \n\nI have been developing this world for the last ten years. Its called Sky Pixel, which I have showcased numerous videos on my YouTube channel @elijahjones as well as my Patreon where I have the world released for download \"Sky Pixel\" \n\nThis Fjord is based off of the landscapes within the Pacific Northwest where I was born and raised. I've done much of the Cascades and Coast Mountains. This area notably is inspired by areas of British Columbia and and Southeastern Alaska. \n\nIf you guys have any tips on my fjord/glacier builds please let me know!! Getting closer to being done with this Fjord and about ready to move onto a new area of my world. \n\nThank you! - Elijah Jones ",
